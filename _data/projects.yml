  description: From a data set of bills in the Chilean Lower House between 2006 and 2018 (<em>N</em> = 4,139), a period that corresponds to three administrations, we draw a random subsample considering some bills per month. We are carrying out two data coding procedures in this subsample in order to identify both the bill’s issue and territorial scope.
