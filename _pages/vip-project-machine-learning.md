## Project Description

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/projects/vip-project.png){: style="width: 350px; float: right; border: 10px"}

<p align="justify">This project addresses the complexity of different political, social, and economic phenomena from a multidisciplinary approach by analysing big data. This project seeks, in particular, to develop and use machine learning applications to detect anomalies in data used by decision-makers and understand current social dynamics and information consumption dynamics.  In general, this project aims to study a number of social science research topics using trained algorithms.</p>

<p align="justify">A case in point is Cambridge Analytica, a company accused of manipulating the 2016 US elections by positioning ideas and perceptions on Facebook. Indeed, during the electoral campaign, the company unauthorisedly collected Facebook user data to conduct micro-targeted campaigns with fake news and disinformation subsequently. This emblematic case demonstrates how the manipulation of big data and machine learning techniques make it possible to affect political results and, thus, impact the economy and public policies of entire countries and regions.</p>

<p align="justify">In the first version of this project (2nd semester, 2021), we will focus precisely on misinformation about economic and public policy issues. To this end, our research team has programmed codes that allow the downloading of large volumes of information from the Chilean press and digital social networks in order to benchmark with different algorithms already trained to identify disinformation dynamics on specific topics. This way, we aim to explore and evaluate thematic gaps and compare their scope with more traditional and reliable information sources.</p>

<p align="justify">A distinguishing characteristic of this project is that we will train our algorithm with Chilean data to identify the particular dynamics of the national reality. In this process, the students who join our team will play a fundamental role through coding and labelling data subsamples to provide inputs to train a classification algorithm.</p>

## Objectives

<p align="justify">This project aims to form a vertically integrated multidisciplinary research team to use different machine learning applications in public policy and economics issues. In this very first version, we will focus on the dynamics of disinformation in economic and public interest issues. We expect to address and analyse other phenomena related to sectoral public policy making and market regulation in subsequent versions.</p>

<p align="justify">Therefore, our main objective for our first case study is:</p>

<ul>
<li>To train a classification algorithm to identify disinformation levels in public policy and economic issues in the Chilean digital sphere.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">The vertical integration with students allows us to establish the following secondary objectives related to the tutoring environment to be developed:</p>

<ul>
<li>To train students in fundamental topics on social science research.</li>
<li>To introduce students to machine learning topics.</li>
<li>•	To train students in programming fundamentals in R.</li>
</ul>

## Research Methodology

<p align="justify">The vertical integration will be carried out between students from different years, principal and associate researchers in a synchronous tutoring environment (workshops or evaluation meetings of one chronological hour) and asynchronous weekly autonomous work with data (three hours per week).</p>
