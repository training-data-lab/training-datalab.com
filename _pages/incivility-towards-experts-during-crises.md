<p align="justify">We are analysing online incivility in the context of extra-governmental experts' appointments to face unexpected, challenging events in Latin American democracies, such as natural disasters and the coronavirus crisis. We focus on the activity on Twitter around specific hashtags and data already downloaded using the Twitter API.</p>

<p align="justify">Our empirical strategy is based on a discontinuity design to estimate the effect of certain events on incivility/toxicity levels.</p>
